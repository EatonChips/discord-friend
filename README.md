# discord-friend
A friend you can have on Discord, because you have no friends.

## Installation

If you just want to add discord-friend to your server: [Click This](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=281870745611665408&scope=bot&permissions=0)

But if you want to host the bot yourself, [Download and install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

Once downloaded, enter the following command to install node modules:

```npm install```

After the node modules install rename config-example.js to config.js and replace \<CLEVERBOT_API_KEY\> and \<DISCORD_API_TOKEN\> with tokens that can be obtained here: [Cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/api/my-account/) [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Once you setup the api keys, run:

```npm start```

The bot is now running, and can be added to your server or whoms't ever's server.
